For the MAD-X workshop at JUAS 2024 we will be using the **MAD-X accelerator design software**, together with **Python** as scripting language and **Jupyter** as interface for the analysis. 

In order to be ready for the workshop please follow the [instructions](./installation_guide.md) **before coming** to JUAS to **prepare yourself** and **your laptop** for the course.

For the workshop we will ask you to download the last version of the [MAD-X Workshop JUAS2024 repository](https://github.com/fusterma/JUAS2024/zipball/master). In this repository you will find one folder for each tutorial with the corresponding jupyter-notebook and MAD-X input files to be completed during the workshop as well as the corresponding solutions. 

The description and questions of the tutorials can be found [here](./Tutorials2024.md).

A list with the main MAD-X, cpymad and Python commands to be used along the tutorials can be found [here](./MainCommandsList.md).
